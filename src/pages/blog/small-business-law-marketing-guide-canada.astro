            Small business law is relationship business. Startups need education before committing. One-off projects should become retainers. Growing businesses have growing legal needs. Automation builds these relationships systematically.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-4">Educating Startup Leads</h2>

          <p>
            Business owners often don't know what legal help they need until it's too late. Educational content about incorporation, contracts, and compliance converts skeptical leads into paying clients.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-4">Project to Retainer Conversion</h2>

          <p>
            An incorporation shouldn't be a one-time transaction. Systematic follow-up highlighting ongoing legal needs—employment agreements, IP protection, compliance—converts projects into retainer relationships.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-12 mb-4">Growing With Your Clients</h2>

          <p>
            As businesses grow, legal needs multiply. Proactive outreach about contracts, HR compliance, and expansion keeps you connected as businesses scale—capturing increasing legal spend.
